**Mama** The only particularly special bit about this movie was the cool hairball ghost. Also game of thrones guy was in it for some reason

**The Hills Have Eyes** Wasn't a huge fan of who they decided to make the hero, but the mutants were kinda nice. Mostly texas chainsaw massacre though.

**Blue Ruin**
Absolutely immense southern gothic. Takes a bunch of notes from the cohen brothers, but on a far lower budget, and backed by horror movies.
