I just finished playing through proteus once last night and I wanted to comment a bit on the experience of it, as it was deeply moving, and triggered some feelings that were unexpected within the context. I probably should also give a shoutout to whatgamesare, as they just recently posted on dear esther, and more generally this class of games, claiming that they are "not games". They go on to say "But I think the folks trying to mix this and game are doing both a disservice. A game is not defined simply by the ability to walk, but to cause meaningful change within it.".

This view of games, as a closed system that the player acts upon, rather than being a part of is what makes proteus not a game. If you include changes within both the psycology and physiology of the player as part of the system, then you can say that proteus is a game, just not in the classic sense. Opening up the definition of game in this way is obviously dangerous however, because it allows things like plays and paintings to be games, as they can interact with external systems in predictable ways. Even a walk in the woods becomes a game, because you can see something that will change your emotional state, and in that way systems have interacted.
