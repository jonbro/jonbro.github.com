This interview that I did about "Lucky Frame and what we are up to":http://www.indiegamepod.com/?p=2934 has just been posted. We talk about what drives our current projects and where we are looking in the future. It was a chat that gave me about 20 ideas for new directions that we could go in the future, and I hope that it is inspiring to other people as well.
