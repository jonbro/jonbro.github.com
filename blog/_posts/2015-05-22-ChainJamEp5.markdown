I just completed my episode of Chain Jam Season 2. You can grab [download links at my itch site](http://jonbro.itch.io/episode-5). Follow along as the episodes are released [on the Dev Log](http://forum.makega.me/t/chain-game-2-schedule-games/1483). There should be a new episode once every three days for the next month and a half!

During this jam I tried out a bunch of different processes for getting hand drawn water colors into a 3d environment. I don't think I figured out the perfect method yet, but I tried out about 5 different techniques. One of them almost got me to give up on the whole jam, but since there were people down the chain depending on me, I powered through.

During the dev process, I made a small unity tool for creating myst style node walking. [You can grab the source or the unity asset package at the github site](https://github.com/jonbro/UnityTool_CameraNodes) I made for the tool.
