Here is a list of the things I made/did last year. 

## Some Music ##

I did a better job of breaking out the musical equipment on a semi-regular basis, but since this playlist represents the some total of all the music I finished, it could probably be a little bit better. I did an ok job of getting rid of hangups and just calling things done though.

## All Together / Candy Bomb ##

Two small puzzle games, I think they made a pretty big difference in my gamemaking approach for the year, and finally allowed me to finish the roguelike that I had been thinking about for a long time.

## Series: Instruments ##

[A collection of 4 instruments played with xbox controller](http://forum.makega.me/t/series-instruments-done/672). Made for the makegame series pagent, and a fun experimentation. One of the songs above is made with one of these instruments. Also I was able to slightly modify one of these to run in kiosk mode at an art installation, which was nice to have a thing sitting around for that purpose.

## Zero Zero Projector ##

Probably the jammiest game I made in the past year, a collection of ideas just stuck into a single package and kinda rushed to get out the door. I think it is fun enough, but also pretty broken over all. I had actually finished the first version of nightmare cooperative before I finished this one, so I had an idea about how roguelikes were supposed to work.

## The Nightmare Cooperative ##

This was the biggest thing I did all year, and it took me about 9 months from beginning to end. We have since sold it to another company, which is nice, since it means that they see longer term potential in its sales than we were able to get. I am a pretty big fan of this game and had an incredibly fun time making the first version of it.

## A Bunch of T-Shirts ##

Twitter was impossible to be on, so I switched my twitter over to a t-shirt advertising business. None of them were turned into physical products, but it was fun to make a shirt a day.

## No More Lucky Frame ##

Was such an amazing ride, and I think that I am totally on a different path with my life now that I have had that experience. Moving on has been tough, but I am excited to see what the future holds.
