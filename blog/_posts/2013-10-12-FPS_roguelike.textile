I have been thinking about this genre connection for a while, apparently way too long, because there are a bunch that are out or coming out real soon. Now, a list:

"Paranautical Activity":http://codeavarice.com/ currently available

"Fancy Skulls":http://www.fancyskulls.com/ alpha available
"Heavy Bullets":http://www.heavybullets.com/ pre-alpha available
"Tower of Guns":http://www.towerofguns.com/ available
"Eldritch":http://www.eldritchgame.com/ available
"Discoverie":http://7dfps.com/?action=games&id=45 7dfps version, available

"Hellgate London":http://hellgate.t3fun.com/home/home.aspx available since 2007, now f2p
"Moraff's World":http://emptysqua.re/blog/moraffs-world/ available, eye of the beholder style
"Disco Fear":http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=33179.0 not yet available, not sure of that name.
"Illuminascii":http://7dfps.com/?action=games&id=89 7dfps version, "ongoing development":http://depressingdrawers.tumblr.com/


I am going to try to livestream plays through some of these. I suspect that I am missing a bunch from the 7dfps this year, so will need to dig through those more. Also if you know of any others, let me know, so that I can play those as well.
