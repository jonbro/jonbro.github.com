Normally I leave off the "here is what I did recently post" until the end of the year. I am feeling the need to get some of that love early this year, so I am going to try doing a weekly update. Hopefully this will keep me focused and dedicated to the little projects that I am plugging on.

I am going to redact some of the details of contract and other necessary redactable work.

I have been working on this doom sector style level editor that lives inside of unity on and off for a few months now. It isn't to the point where it is really fast or fun to use yet, but I am closing in on bugs at the very least. This week I worked on some really necessary features, including moving lines and verts around. The secondary thing that I am working on with this is a [cover game for this forum thread](http://forum.makega.me/t/covers-based-on-a-screenshot/1318) that everyone except me has forgotten about.
