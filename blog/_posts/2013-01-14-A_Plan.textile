title: A Plan
---

I am going to try to finish more things this year. I was a bit disappointed that I looked back on 2012, and didn't have a "crazy long list of games like I did for 2011":http://jonbro.tk/blog/2012/01/12/year_of_games.html. Some might argue that it is quality over quantity ("one of the 2012 games got into the igf for petes sake":http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html), but proliferation is its own reward. I also started a bunch of games last year, but never finished them to the point that I was comfortable with releasing them. This year I am going to try my hardest to get things to a state where I enjoy them, and where I feel comfortable with giving them to others.

As such, I am going to participate in "1GAM":http://onegameamonth.com, a project in which I am going to release 12 games in 2013. I think it should be doable, I already have the first 3 lined up, I just need to come up with another 9. I am also writing "750 words a day":http://750words.com/ for the month of January. Writing is one of the skills that I feel like I am lacking in the games that I make personally. It is amortized a bit by working with lucky frame, but my jam games suffer from a lack of story. I will probably post up an ebook of my rambling for anyone that is brave enough to download it at the end of the month.
