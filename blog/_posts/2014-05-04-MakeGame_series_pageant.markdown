title: Make Game Series pageant
---

[Make Game](http://MakeGa.me) is a forum which is a sequel and successor to the now defunct superfriendshipclub. I was a sometimes member of the superfriendship club right when I was starting out making games full time. It was an interesting place to hang out, with a much different focus than most of forums for indie games that I had found at the time.

One of the best parts of it was the pageant section, which gave rise to a series of really interesting jams. At the time, I didn't feel ready to approach the themes, they were too big for me to wrap my mind around. I thought I was ready, but of course the first theme for the ressurected pageants is blowing my mind. Please join me in participating in "Series".

The instructions from Ian Snyder:

> Make a two or more small games all revolving around one central theme or idea that when taken together form one cohesive whole. Make the games good.
