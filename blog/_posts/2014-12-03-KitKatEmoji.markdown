title: Android KitKat Emoji
---

Google does something good every once in a while, and recently they commisioned a set of emoji that is licensed with the liberal apache license. You can get this emoji set in the [Noto Sans fontpack](https://www.google.com/get/noto/). 

I have extracted the emoji set to a [png set that you can download here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43672/notoColorEmoji.zip). This set happens to be my favorite, because just look at these cute little squishies.
