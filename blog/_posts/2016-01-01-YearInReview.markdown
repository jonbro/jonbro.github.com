Here is a list of the things I made/did in 2015. 

## MLGEd ##

I think this is fair enough to put on here, even though I am now working on it again. I had intended to actually make more games with it, but it turned out that wasn't really my style. I think I was making it for other people, and it turned out to not be for anyone but myself, really.

## Salvage Crew ##

[A game for 7drl](http://jonbro.tk/blog/2015/03/18/SalvageCrew.html), made in collaboration with Cale Bradbury and Sal Farina. I don't think it turned out too great, but I finished it in time for 7drl at least.

## Chain Jam 2 / Episode 5 ##

[I made a little myst style game for this jam](http://jonbro.tk/blog/2015/05/22/ChainJamEp5.html). I swapped graphical styles about 4 times over the course of 2 days, but somehow it turned out relatively coherent.

## Contract Work ##

I spent a bunch of time working on contract work that has yet to be released. Hopefully this year?

## Sector Editor ##

*unfinished*

I spent a bunch of time working on a sector editor that runs inside of unity. This means that I can theoretically build doom style levels in unity very very easily. I don't actually know who I am making this for. So far, all I have to show for it are some neat screenshots.

## Delia Mute ##

[A roguelike I made in pico-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2166&autoplay=1#pp). It has memory issues that mean you can't play through a full game, but it is pretty nice outside of that. Was thinking that I would port it to iOS, and then completely forgot about that plan.

## The other things ##

I spent a significant amount of time working on a CYOA editor for iOS. I don't think it is for me though, so it probably won't get finished. I also spent some time working on my tracker for iOS, which def is for me, but it just feels like I will never recoup my investment on it, so it is painful to work on. So much of this past year has been forcing myself to work on things that I know I will never make any money on, and being sad about that. Hopefully in 2016 I will be able to get over that issue.
