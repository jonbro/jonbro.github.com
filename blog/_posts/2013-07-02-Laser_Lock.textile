title: Laser Lock
---

I just made this small game for one game a month called laser lock. It was mostly made on trains, but had a little bit of actual office coding stuck in there for good measure. Partially inspired by "this blog post by smestorp":http://mightyvision.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/overlapping-input-competitive.html, I decided to expand on the one mechanic that is a shared control input thing in "our new big game":http://luckyframe.co.uk/gentlemen that we are working on at lucky frame. The first thing I did was think "what is the most simplest form to express this idea in", and promptly forgot what was cool about the idea. No matter, I pressed on, and came up with this laser reflecting action game for two players. While there were some intresting things that came out of making this, in the end, it was more the aesthetic and sound that was interesting. I would like to revisit the original idea, which was more about just pressing buttons at the correct time, where half the time the button is correct for you and half the time it is correct for the other player. The issue I think this game illustrates is that even the smallest amount of complexity and distance from a clear solution to a problem can quickly multiply and become impossible to manage.

Here is the "android apk download for laser lock":https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43672/blog_static/software/laserLock.apk. Only tested on nexus 7, but should work on most recent android tablets.
