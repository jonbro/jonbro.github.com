Always wonderful to be working with good people. Along with "yann seznec":http://www.theamazingrolo.net/ and "mike greer":http://www.deepfriedconcepts.com/, I am proud to present the preview video for mujik, our upcoming iPhone software.

Some technical details, for those that can stomach the stuff. This was built with the wonderful "openframeworks":http://www.openframeworks.cc/, using some ideas that I jotted down during the workshop given during the "art and code conference":http://artandcode.ning.com/. 

The audio is done using remoteIO, which may not have been the smartest decision, but certainly worked. I think for future projects I am going to experiment with using audioqueues, partially because they seem like a much easier interface, and partially because they might not require as much optomization in my audio routines.

All of the textures ended up needing to be compiled into texture atlases, so we could fit them all in. The iPhone (<=3G) has an extremely small texture memory and we had to look for any place we could to shave bytes. I can't wait until everyone is on 3GS or greater, the graphics capabilities of the phone have been changed so much it is rediculous.

There are a few more things to iron out, but look for this coming out in july.
