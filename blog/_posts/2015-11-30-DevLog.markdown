Slightly shorter work this week due to family and holidays. A bunch of the untracked time this week was dedicated to playing board games and cleaning out basements.

The time that I did spend on personal projects this week was largely dedicated to doing an edition of drawings. I had built this lego plotter a few weeks ago, but never got around to writing the code to run it. This week I did, and got some neat L-System drawings out of it. It was pretty fun to not know what kind of drawing you were going to get until the pen actually dumped it out.

Speaking of which, 3 out of the 6 drawings in this edition are unspoken for. Let me know if you want one, and we can work it out.

I got one huge bug fixed on the doom editor this week. Then I lost all ability to work on it.
