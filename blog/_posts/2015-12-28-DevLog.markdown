A much shorter week, due to holidays.

Started porting the web based action editor that I was working on to emscripten. This was pretty necessary due to slowdown in the lua.vm.js bridge functions. I am not doing much beyond writing wrappers for some functions right now.

Spent a little bit of time on the doom editor and iPad CYOA thing as well, but nothing significant. I don't really know where either of those are going. In particular, the CYOA thing feels too slight to be worth finishing. Maybe I should send it out to people and see if anyone likes it or not.

Coming later this week: my yearly roundup of what I did. I am somewhat looking forward to that.
