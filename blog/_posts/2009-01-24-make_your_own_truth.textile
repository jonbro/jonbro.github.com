We are in the final production stages of this giant book that I have been working on with "Encyclopedia Destructica":http://www.encyclopediadestructica.com/ for the past 6 months or so. It ended up clocking in just under 500 pages, which is kind of mind bogglingly big for a handmade print publication. The covers are all neon and grey and have little poems on them by "starpaws":http://starpause.com, and awesome drawings from Chris of Encyclopedia Destructica. The grand total comes to 8 little books, and one big book all contained within a fancy slipcover.

*The Main book has the following work from me:*
* A series of 3d models based on photos of empty rooms that people publically uploaded to the internet
* Landscapes, two generations removed, from directions given on twitter by anonymous posters
* Several motivational posters
* A lecture (with script and materials necessary to give the presentation again)

*The main section of the book also contains new works from the following artists*:
"Alberto J. Almarza":http://vimeo.com/user529399, "Juliacks":http://www.juliacks.com/, "Rick Gribenas":http://www.gribenas.com/ and "Josh Atlas":http://www.joshatlas.com/.
They were given the prompt to work on "invisible forces", which is the same place that I started from.

I also organized two evenings of lectures on a wide variety of topics. The only rules were that the presentations could not be on the contents of the presenters day jobs. Of the 24 lectures given, 8 were reprinted and bound along with the main book. The lectures reprinted are by:
M. Callen, T. Foley, Curt Gettman, Brett Kashmere, Laura MIller, Shaun Slifer, Greg Siegle, and Jim Storch

*The book release info is as follows:*
* The Flying Destructicate: Make Your Own Truth book release and award presentation
* January 31st
* 5:30pm - 8:30 @ the Miller Gallery on CMU's campus.
