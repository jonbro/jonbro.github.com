The first "Pittsburgh Visionary Arts Festival":http://pghvisionaryartsfestival.com/ is bringing together more than 50 local visionary artists and art innovators into a single venue. For three full days, these artists will share their work, vision and unique ideas in a friendly outdoors festival setting.

I will have a booth at this event, as well as playing in the hiTec Orchestra all three nights.
