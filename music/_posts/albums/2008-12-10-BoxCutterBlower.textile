Feeling totally bummed out, I made this super harsh improvisational noise album in the course of 24 hours. I also produced an extremely short run of 3 nice cds with printing and packaging. I have yet to sell/give them away.

All these tracks were made with a wall of amps, a loop pedal, a floor tom, a bass guitar, a vocal mic, and DS-10.

ProcRecs stepped up and released it along with some really nice superlatives. I would suggest that you go read further on their site.
