MUCH LOVE TO PROC RECZ! I started doing _The Wizard Rises_ with two limitations: The entire set needs to be transportable by bike and There is no such thing as cliche.

Another side goal is to explore how close to actual techno I can get. This all comes kinda close. These tracks were produced on DS-10 and LGPT.

The zipfile below contains a whole bunch of artists, including myself. All of the releases are 1.44meg.
