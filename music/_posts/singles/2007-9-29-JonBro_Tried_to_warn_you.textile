One of the better tracks I wrote for the LGPT + Drums + Voice project. I was trying to just use very basic wave forms on all of these things.

On another note, I really feel at home with the HexAwe krew, they have helped me out musically more than I can really comprehend, and I feel like the friendships I have made with them are some of the strongest I have made with people on the internet. IRC FTW.
