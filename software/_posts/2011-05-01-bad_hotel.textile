An action puzzeler building game made for "ludum dare 20":http://ludumdare.com. With music from "Yann Seznec":http://theamazingrolo.net. You can see the whole development journal here. It is kind of a pain to play, but you can create cool looking "DLA":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation style buildings in it, until they get knocked down by missiles.
