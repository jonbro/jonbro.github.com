The final game in the set of music creation games that we did at Lucky Frame. I am sure there will be more, the next thing we do will not be as clearly connected. This game is a cross between a cave flyer and sound shapes. I am really proud of the game design decisions that we made on this one, I think it is both accessible and deep.
